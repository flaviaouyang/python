# List vs Tuples vs Sets vs Dictionary

## Overview

1. list: collection of ordered data
2. tuple: ordered collection of data
3. set: unordered collection
4. dictionary: unordered collection of data that are stored in (key, value) pairs

## Differences

- Tuples are immutable, lists, sets, and dictionaries are all mutable
- Sets are unordered and its members are unique (no duplicates)
- Keys in dictionaries cannot have duplicates
